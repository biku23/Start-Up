              <h3>Electrical panel installation, upgrading, and replacement</h3>
              <p>You might not know what the upgrade process is for electrical panels. If you've had no noticeable issues with the entire electrical system, you might not have an incentive to focus on upgrades.<br>

                Generally, it includes new fuse boxes, a circuit breaker, and an update of your amp service from the utility company. Those who notice flickering lights should definitely think about electrical panel replacement because it could cause electrical fires. Sometimes, this indicates overloaded circuits, and you need an experienced electrician to put in a new panel and handle the electrical work.</p>
